<h2><a name="news"></a>News</h2>
<h3>First release!</h3>
<h5>Sunday 7th January 2007</h5>
<p>
I've finally gotten around to doing a release, it is version 0.0.3 (previous 
versions havn't been released). This version has full support for displaying
 in pygame and wxPython. You can download it from this
<a href="binaries/">location.</a>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Website Setup</h3>
<h5>Monday 4th December 2006</h5>
<p>
I've been working on libmng-py for a month or so now. It was my first ctypes
wrapper so it's been a cool experiance. I've now finally setup a webpage and
will do an inital public release in the next couple of days.

<h2><a name="about"></a>What is libmng-py?</h2>
<p>
libmng-py is a Python wrapper around the libmng C library. It currently supports
the most important parts of the library and supports displaying and usage with
the most popular toolkits (such as pygame and wxPython).
</p><p>
I started it because I need an animation format with full alpha channel
support (as appose to GIF which only has a alpha mask) and no other
python library supported MNG.
</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>Full support for all libmng functionality</li>
  <li>Out of the box support for popular toolkits</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
Currently supports:
 <ul>
  <li>Raw output in any format libmng supports</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pygame.org">pygame</a> (SDL) output (detects the best format for fast blitting)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wxPython.org">wxPython</a> animation control (like GIFAnimationCtrl)</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="qna"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What is python?</h3>
<p>
Python is cross-platform and object-oriented. It's easy-to-learn,
easy-to-use, easy-to-read, easy-to-extend. It is also very important
that python is increasingly popular.
</p>
<h3>What is MNG?</h3>
<p>
MNG (pronounced "ming") is an animated version of the PNG format. Originally
designed to replace the GIF format web adoption never really gained traction. 
</p><p>
libmng-py should have full support for all mng features that libmng supports.
</p>
<h3>What is JNG?</h3>
<p>
JNG is a similar format to MNG but uses JPEG as it's base format.
</p><p>
If libmng you are using was compiled with JPEG support then libmng-py should
also support JNGs.
</p>
<h3>Why not used GIF?</h3>
<p>
GIF only has support for limited alpha, a pixel is either transparent or not.
MNG has support for a proper alpha channel like PNG. This means that you can have
nice blended edges and similar. GIF animations converted into MNG also are about 
20% smaller!
</p>
<h3>Why not use a bunch of PNGs?</h3>
<p>
By using a bunch of PNGs means you have increased size. The MNG will be much 
smaller because the bits of the pictures which are repeated in each frame will
not be replicated.
</p><p>
A bunch of PNGs also does not have anyway to have loops,variable delays or similar.
</p>
<h3>Why not use a bunch of MPEG?</h3>
<p>
If you want video then MPEG and related video standards are much better for you.
However these formats are not suited to graphics used in games which often need
proper alpha channels so they can be blended.

<h2><a name="screenshots"></a>Screenshots</h2>
<p>
The following screenshot shows the output from the pygame-example.py (the first image
has is full 32bit color with alpha channel and the second image is 8bit pallette with
transparent color).
